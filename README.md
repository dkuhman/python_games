# Welcome to Python Games
This repository contains Python scripts that allow users to play simple games.

## Hangman
The user plays "hangman" in the command prompt, guessing a word randomly selected by the computer from a .txt file. This is a good 
starter assignment that includes looping, conditionals, simple built-in functions, and work with lists

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
The user plays rock, paper, scissors against the "computer" in the command prompt. This script is a good starter assignment to work with
loops, conditional statements, and simple built-in functions.

## Tanks
The user plays tanks! At the moment, the game only includes a single level where the useer controls a tank and fires missiles to collect coins. I am building this into a classic game of tanks (player vs cpu and player vs player). There is still a lot of work to do on this game!
