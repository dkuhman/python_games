# hangman_python
This repository contains a simple Python script that allows a user to play a game of hangman in the command window. It utilizes basic built-in functions, lists, conditionals, for and while loops, and a lot of work with strings!
The .txt file contains a list of words that the script will choose from randomly - please feel free to add more words to the file!
